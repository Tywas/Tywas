- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Tyler or @Tywas

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in coding and am excited to be learning more about it. Iâ€™m currently learning the
  programing language Java though Boise State University.  While at Boise State University, I have been
  persuing Computer Science and expect to graduate with a Bachelor's of Engineering degree by 2024.  I 
  also try to teach myself Python here and there when I have free time.
